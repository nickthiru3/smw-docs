# Merchant sign up

Merchants can sign up for a pre-verified merchant account

## Scenario: Successful sign up

    Visits merchant sign up page

    Fills in merchant details

    Submits merchant details

    Is shown a message asking them to check their email for a verification code

      Code is only valid for 24 hours?

    Receives welcome email with verification code and unique URL to the "confirm email" page

      Apart from email message, there just needs to be a verify email button without the code displayed

      When the user clicks on the verify email button, they are taken to the /auth/confirm-sign-up page, with the url containing two path parameters: /auth/confirm-sign-up/username={email}&code={code}

    Verifies email

      The page should display "verifying. please hold on"-type of message or something similar

      The page server needs to read the two values from the path parameter and pass it to amplify's confirmSignUp api

      Based on the result, the page should then update the display something similar to "your email has been verified. please click on the 'sign in' button below to sign in", or an error message if the verification failed

    Receives email with follow-up instructions to complete document verification

### Lambda

**Name**: MerchantSignUpLambda  
**Runtime**: Node.js 20.x  
**Handler**: handler  
**Files**:

- Handler: `backend/src/lambda/merchants/account/sign-up/handler.js`

- USER_POOL_CLIENT_ID: Cognito User Pool Client ID

**IAM Permissions**:

- cognito-idp:SignUp (Allow)
- cognito-idp:AdminAddUserToGroup (Allow on User Pool ARN)

**Function Logic**:

1. Receives merchant sign-up data from API Gateway
2. Performs dynamic business validations:
   - Validates year of registration is not in the future
   - Validates year of registration is not too old (before 1900)
   - Validates website URL format if provided
   - Validates primary contact email is different from business email
3. Creates Cognito user with SignUpCommand
4. Sets all required attributes:
   - email
   - custom:businessName
   - custom:userGroup
   - custom:registrationNumber
   - custom:yearOfRegistration
   - custom:website
   - custom:address (JSON string)

5. Adds user to "Merchants" group with AdminAddUserToGroupCommand
6. Returns success response with username and message

## Frontend

### Routes:

- `/merchants/sign-up`: Multi-step merchant registration form
- `/auth/verification-sent`: Verification email confirmation page
- `/auth/confirm-sign-up`: Code verification page

### Sign-up Page

**Files**:

- Component: `sveltekit/src/routes/merchants/sign-up/+page.svelte`
- Server Actions: `sveltekit/src/routes/merchants/sign-up/+page.server.js`
- Validation Schema: `sveltekit/src/routes/merchants/sign-up/schema.js`

**Features**:

- Multi-step form with 3 steps:
  - Step 1: Account Information (business name, email, password)
  - Step 2: Business Information (registration number, year, business type, website)
  - Step 3: Contact Information (address, phone, primary contact, product categories)
- Client-side validation using Svelte 5 runes
- Server-side validation using Zod schemas
- Progress indicator showing current step
- Form state persistence between steps using cookies
- Responsive design using Tailwind CSS
- Error handling and feedback

**Implementation**:

- Uses Svelte 5 runes for reactivity:
  - `$state()` for reactive variables
  - `$derived()` for computed values
  - `$effect()` for side effects
- Follows universal component format (no separate script/style sections)
- Implements progressive enhancement with server-side form handling
- Uses Tailwind CSS for styling
- Communicates with backend API through merchant service

### Verification Sent Page

**Files**:

- Component: `sveltekit/src/routes/auth/verification-sent/+page.svelte`
- Server Load: `sveltekit/src/routes/auth/verification-sent/+page.server.js`

**Features**:

- Confirmation that account was created successfully
- Instructions to check email for verification code
- Countdown timer for code expiration (5 minutes)
- Buttons to:
  - Enter verification code
  - Resend verification code
  - Go to sign-in
- Adapts messaging based on user type (merchant or customer)
- Secure access (redirects if no pending confirmation)

**Implementation**:

- Uses Svelte 5 runes for reactivity
- Loads email and user type data from cookies
- Implements countdown timer with cleanup on component unmount
- Uses Tailwind CSS for responsive design
- Provides clear user guidance on next steps

### API Integration

**Files**:

- Service: `sveltekit/src/lib/services/api/merchantService.js`

**Features**:

- Handles API communication between frontend and backend
- Supports both real API and mock API for development
- Standardized error handling
- Type definitions using JSDoc

**Implementation**:

- `signUp()` function sends merchant data to backend API
- Handles success and error responses
- Returns standardized response format
- Supports development with mock data

### Validation Schema

**Files**:

- Frontend: `sveltekit/src/routes/merchants/sign-up/schema.js`
- Backend: `backend/lib/api/http/endpoints/merchants/account/sign-up/schema.js`

**Features**:

- Step-specific validation schemas
- Comprehensive field validation
- Custom error messages
- Type safety

**Implementation**:

- Frontend: Uses Zod for form validation with three schemas:
  - `step1Schema`: Validates account information
  - `step2Schema`: Validates business information
  - `step3Schema`: Validates contact information
- Backend: Uses "JSON schema draft 4" to generate Schema for API Gateway validation

## Integration Points

1. **Frontend to Backend**:

   - SvelteKit form submits to page server action
   - Server action calls merchant service API
   - API Gateway validates request using schema
   - Lambda processes request and creates Cognito user

2. **Email Verification Flow**:

   - Cognito triggers custom message Lambda
   - Custom email sent based on user type
   - User redirected to verification sent page
   - User enters code on confirm sign-up page

3. **Post-Verification**:
   - User status changes from UNCONFIRMED to CONFIRMED
   - User can sign in with verified credentials
   - User receives follow-up instructions for document verification
