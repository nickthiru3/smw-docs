I need to integrate a new UX Pilot generated page into my SvelteKit project. Here are the details:

1. Target file path: [e.g., frontend/src/routes/merchants/sign-up/+page.svelte]

2. UX Pilot generated code:

[Paste the full UX Pilot HTML code here]

3. Integration guidelines:

   - Don't modify existing components in shared directories
   - Create backups (.bak) of any existing components before modifying
   - Extract color variables to app.css if needed
   - Move Google Fonts and other libraries to app.html
   - Organize components following our established structure
   - Preserve any existing business logic and form validation

4. Special considerations:

   - Preserve existing functionality [from reference file path, if applicable]
   - The page needs to [describe any specific functionality needed]
   - This is the merchant dashboard. Use the layout and page files. Keep the components that will likely remain unchanged in the layout. The page will be a sub-page within the dashboard, with the current view as the components that pertain to the home view/tab so keep those in the page file. As we build out the other sub-pages/menu items of the merchants dashboard, each one will be a page within the dashboard layout.
   - Use Tailwind CSS for styling (already in UX Pilot output)

Please analyze the UX Pilot code first and provide your integration approach before implementing any changes.
