## Instructions

In the left-hand side of the table, describe the access pattern you have. If you have unique needs around an access pattern, be sure to list those in the Notes column.

As you design your data model, you will fill in the right-hand side of your table. This column describes the DynamoDB API call you
will use and any details about the call â€” the table or index you use, the parameters used in your API call, and any notes.
